# Open Text Compare

A simple, beautiful web-based tool to compare text files by line or word, with highlighting, diff navigation, and export functionalities.
This web application processes all data locally in your browser. No text is uploaded or stored on any server, making it more secure and private by design.

## Why was it built?
This app was born out of a need for a private, lightweight, and easy-to-use alternative to server-based diff tools. Many existing solutions require file uploads or online accounts. This one works entirely inside your browser.
No installation. No sign-up. No data leaves your device.

## Features

- Compare by line
- Highlight added/removed/modified lines
- Highlight modified words within a line
- Export results (CSV, TXT, Email, Copy)
- Navigate between changes
- Language support
- Open source and user-friendly
- All functionalities run within the browser

## Future Features

- ignore trailing white spaces
- ignore space/tab differences
- contacts (X, instagram, email)
- create tests
- improve colors and create a separate file to hold the different color themes
- fix the languages: transpose all texts within the file to the translations.js
- make texts of README, ABOUT and PRIVACY reusable. Maybe a tool to generate about and privacy pages automatically from the readme?
	- implement a markdown parser to hold the about and privacy pages
- accept files
- create a button to show results in two columns
- fix showing spaces and tabs
- Add "How to use" page

## Test
In order to test it locally, I recommend using a CORS disabled version of your browser. Here's an example on how to open the chrome:
- Windows
`bash
start chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:\chrome_dev"
`

- Mac
`bash
open -na "Google Chrome" --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev"
`

- Linux
`bash
google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev"
